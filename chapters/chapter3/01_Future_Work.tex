\subsection{Year 3 from October 2019 to September 2020}
\par Going forward I would like to work on the metatronic fabrication effort since I have spent most of my research time thus far working on understanding the mathematical underpinning of finite difference computing, writing software, and building computational models. One of the initial challenges metatronically will be constructing nanophotonic local near field probes that readout all displacement current mesh points in parallel.

\subsection{Year 4 from October 2020 to September 2021}
\par In the final year I hope I will be able to program a fabricated metatronic ROC to be used as an analog accelerator within a numerical parallel multi grid method to see if we can demonstrate computational time complexity speedups over purely software based implementations.
