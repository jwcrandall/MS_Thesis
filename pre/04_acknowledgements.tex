The research environment at GW has provided me with time, equipment, and colleagues to learn from and collaborate with, some of which I would like to thank explicitly. Engin Kayraklioglu has been instrumental in the development of the first iteration of the ROC software stack which includes SPICE models, usage of the Lumerical API, and is now starting to focus on error correction and will eventually involve ROC drivers. I hope to keep collaborating with you on this GitHub repository. Shuai Sun has been my desk mate ever since I started working in the OPEN Lab. He has led the fabrication of photonic ROC as well as being one of the first people in the Lab to learn the Lumerical simulation tool set. I have asked Shuai many questions and he has answered even more. Even since the arrival of our Postdoc Mario Miscuglio, my research has been accelerated. Mario's depth and breath of photonic and metatronic knowledge and modeling skill has motivated me to improve me own. PI Tarek El-Ghazawi has provided extensive edits throughout the thesis process and I greatly appreciate his input. Finally I would like to thank my PI Volker Sorger for both his edits during the thesis writing process and for pushing this team aggressively and helping to put us on the map. Thank you all.
