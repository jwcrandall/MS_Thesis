  abstract={It is shown in this paper that resistance networks are capable of very high accuracy in the solution of partial differential equations with given boundary conditions, as the networks possess certain averaging properties. Fairly exhaustive tests carried out on a resistance network constructed by the author gave accuracies in the range of 1 part in 1 000 to 1 part in 10 000. The design of this resistance network is described; it is of the axially symmetrical type, with 60 meshes in the z -direction and 20 meshes in the r -direction, and is surrounded by a termination strip. Fifty current feeding points for adjusting boundary conditions are provided. The boundaries of the models need not coincide with the mesh points as correction can be made by local modifications of the network. It is also possible to take measurements within a mesh of the network and to simulate the introduction of dielectric material into an electric field. The high accuracy, and simplicity and speed of operation, make the resistance network a useful tool in the investigation of field distributions in many branches of science and engineering.}

  abstract={A general method for deriving the finite difference approximations to the partial differential equation div K grad U = g , which is solved by resistance-network analogues, is applied to find the resistance values and the currents which have to be fed in for ( x , y )- and ( r , z )-networks with unequal mesh sizes. Two ways of subdividing a network into finer meshes in the ratio 1: 2 are then given, and a network subdivision in the ratio 2: 5 is described. Experimental tests have shown that these subdivisions introduce negligible errors into the measured field distributions.}

  abstract={When solving the wave equation ∇ 2 U + k 2 U = 0, and similar field problems, on resistance-network analogues by iteration, an error signal can be derived which is a measure of how far the analogue solution satisfies the given equation. An experimental apparatus is described for displaying simultaneously, on a cathode-ray tube screen, the error signals ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsilon.gif] {epsilon} for a number of resistance-network points; the solution then proceeds until all ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsilon.gif] {epsilon} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 0. The apparatus can also be used to display network voltages or gradients, which is helpful in many other kinds of problems solved with resistance-network analogues, and to obtain solutions of "best fit" in equation solvers.}

Such processing typically requires complex systems of bulk optical elements such as lenses, filters, and mirrors. Mohammadi Estakhri et al. demonstrate that specially designed nanophotonic structures can take input waveforms encoded as complex mathematical functions, manipulate them, and provide an output that is the integral of the functions. The results, demonstrated for microwaves, provide a route to develop chip-based analog optical computers and computing elements.Science, this issue p. 1333Metastructures hold the potential to bring a new twist to the field of spatial-domain optical analog computing: migrating from free-space and bulky systems into conceptually wavelength-sized elements. We introduce a metamaterial platform capable of solving integral equations using monochromatic electromagnetic fields. For an arbitrary wave as the input function to an equation associated with a prescribed integral operator, the solution of such an equation is generated as a complex-valued output electromagnetic field. Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies through solving a generic integral equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.},

However, there is no way to implement these materials on a photonic chip, restricting the investigation and application of zero-index phenomena to simple shapes and small scales. We designed and fabricated an on-chip integrated metamaterial with a refractive index of zero in the optical regime. Light refracts perpendicular to the facets of a prism made of this metamaterial, directly demonstrating that the index of refraction is zero. The metamaterial consists of low-aspect-ratio silicon pillar arrays embedded in a polymer matrix and clad by gold films. This structure can be fabricated using standard planar processes over a large area in arbitrary shapes and can efficiently couple to photonic integrated circuits and other optical elements. This novel on-chip metamaterial platform opens the door to exploring the physics of zero index and its applications in integrated optics.},

    abstract = {The concept of metamaterial-inspired nanocircuits, dubbed metatronics, was introduced in \[Science 317, 1698 (2007); Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 095504 (2005)\]. It was suggested how optical lumped elements (nanoelements) can be made using subwavelength plasmonic or non-plasmonic particles. As a result, the optical metatronic equivalents of a number of electronic circuits, such as frequency mixers and filters, were suggested. In this work we further expand the concept of electronic lumped element networks into optical metatronic circuits and suggest a conceptual model applicable to various metatronic passive networks. In particular, we differentiate between the series and parallel networks using epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and mu-near-zero (MNZ) materials. We employ layered structures with subwavelength thicknesses for the nanoelements as the building blocks of collections of metatronic networks. Furthermore, we explore how by choosing the non-zero constitutive parameters of the materials with specific dispersions, either Drude or Lorentzian dispersion with suitable parameters, capacitive and inductive responses can be achieved in both series and parallel networks. Next, we proceed with the one-to-one analogy between electronic circuits and optical metatronic filter layered networks and justify our analogies by comparing the frequency response of the two paradigms. Finally, we examine the material dispersion of near-zero relative permittivity as well as other physically important material considerations such as losses.}

All these applications require integrated and voltage-efficient modulator solutions with compact form factors that are seamlessly integrable with silicon photonics platforms and feature near-CMOS material processing synergies. However, existing integrated modulators are challenged to meet these requirements. Conversely, emerging electro-optic materials heterogeneously and monolithically integrated with Si photonics open up a new avenue for device engineering. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is one such compelling material for heterogeneous integration in Si exhibiting formidable electro-optic effect characterized by unity-order index change at telecommunication frequencies. Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a monolithically integrated ITO electro-optic modulator based on a Mach Zehnder interferometer featuring a high-performance half-wave voltage and active device length product of VÏL = 0.52 V mm. We show that the unity-strong index change enables a 30 ÎŒm-short Ï-phase shifter operating ITO in the index-dominated region away from the epsilon-near-zero point for reduced losses. This device experimentally confirms electrical phase shifting in ITO enabling its use in applications such as compact phase shifters, nonlinear activation functions in photonic neural networks, and phased array applications for LiDAR.},

More recently ITO has shown epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) behavior in the telecommunication frequency band enabling both strong index modulation and other optically-exotic applications such as metatronics. However the ability to precisely obtain targeted electrical and optical material properties in ITO is still challenging due to complex intrinsic effects in ITO and as such no integrated metatronic platform has been demonstrated to-date. Here we deliver an extensive and accurate description process parameters of RF-sputtering, showing a holistic control of the quality of ITO thin films in the visible and particularly near-infrared spectral region. We further are able to custom-engineer the ENZ point across the telecommunication band by explicitly controlling the sputtering process conditions.

    Optical signal processing of light waves can represent certain mathematical functions and perform computational tasks on signals or images in an analog fashion. However, the complex systems of lenses and filters required are bulky. Metamaterials can perform similar optical processing operations but with materials that need only be a wavelength thick. Silva et al. (p. 160; see the Perspective by Sihvola) present a simulation study that shows how an architecture based on such metamaterials can be designed to perform a suite of mathematical functions to create ultrathin optical signal and data processors.
    We introduce the concept of metamaterial analog computing, based on suitably designed metamaterial blocks that can perform mathematical operations (such as spatial differentiation, integration, or convolution) on the profile of an impinging wave as it propagates through these blocks. Two approaches are presented to achieve such functionality: (i) subwavelength structured metascreens combined with graded-index waveguides and (ii) multilayered slabs designed to achieve a desired spatial Greenâs function. Both techniques offer the possibility of miniaturized, potentially integrable, wave-based computing systems that are thinner than conventional lens-based optical signal and data processors by several orders of magnitude.
    An approach is described whereby metamaterials can be designed to perform a suite of mathematical functions. [Also see Perspective by Sihvola]

    Deep learning uses multilayered artificial neural networks to learn digitally from large datasets. It then performs advanced identification and classification tasks. To date, these multilayered neural networks have been implemented on a computer. Lin et al. demonstrate all-optical machine learning that uses passive optical components that can be patterned and fabricated with 3D-printing. Their hardware approach comprises stacked layers of diffractive optical elements analogous to an artificial neural network that can be trained to execute complex functions at the speed of light.
    Science, this issue p. 1004
    Deep learning has been transforming our ability to execute advanced inference tasks using computers. Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learningâbased design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D2NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object classification; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D2NNs.

Exploiting this isomorphism, a simulated 24-node silicon photonic neural network is programmed using âneural compilerâ to solve a differential system emulation task.

	abstract = {In atomic multi-level systems, adiabatic elimination (AE) is a method used to minimize complicity of the system by eliminating irrelevant and strongly coupled levels by detuning them from one another. Such a three-level system, for instance, can be mapped onto physically in the form of a three-waveguide system. Actively detuning the coupling strength between the respective waveguide modes allows modulating light to propagate through the device, as proposed here. The outer waveguides act as an effective two-photonic-mode system similar to ground and excited states of a three-level atomic system, while the center waveguide is partially plasmonic. In AE regime, the amplitude of the middle waveguide oscillates much faster when compared to the outer waveguides leading to a vanishing field build up. As a result, the plasmonic intermediate waveguide becomes a âdark state,â hence nearly zero decibel insertion loss is expected with modulation depth (extinction ratio) exceeding 25 dB. Here, the modulation mechanism relies on switching this waveguide system from a critical coupling regime to AE condition via electrostatically tuning the free-carrier concentration and hence the optical index of a thin indium thin oxide (ITO) layer resides in the plasmonic center waveguide. This alters the effective coupling length and the phase mismatching condition thus modulating in each of its outer waveguides. Our results also promise a power consumption as low as 49.74aJ/bit. Besides, we expected a modulation speed of 160 GHz reaching to millimeter wave range applications. Such anticipated performance is a direct result of both the unity-strong tunability of the plasmonic optical mode in conjunction with utilizing ultra-sensitive modal coupling between the critically coupled and the AE regimes. When taken together, this new class of modulators paves the way for next generation both for energy and speed conscience optical short-reach communication such as those found in interconnects.},

	abstract = {Electro-optic modulators have been identified as the key drivers for optical communication and signal processing. With an ongoing miniaturization of photonic circuitries, an outstanding aim is to demonstrate an on-chip, ultra-compact, electro-optic modulator without sacrificing bandwidth and modulation strength. While silicon-based electro-optic modulators have been demonstrated, they require large device footprints of the order of millimeters as a result of weak non-linear electro-optical properties. The modulation strength can be increased by deploying a high-Q resonator, however with the trade-off of significantly sacrificing bandwidth. Furthermore, design challenges and temperature tuning limit the deployment of such resonance-based modulators. Recently, novel materials like graphene have been investigated for electro-optic modulation applications with a 0.1 dB per micrometer modulation strength, while showing an improvement over pure silicon devices, this design still requires device lengths of tens of micrometers due to the inefficient overlap between the thin graphene layer, and the optical mode of the silicon waveguide. Here we experimentally demonstrate an ultra-compact, silicon-based, electro-optic modulator with a record-high 1 dB per micrometer extinction ratio over a wide bandwidth range of 1 ÎŒm in ambient conditions. The device is based on a plasmonic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) waveguide, which efficiently concentrates the optical modesâ electric field into a nanometer thin region comprised of an absorption coefficient-tuneable indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The modulation mechanism originates from electrically changing the free carrier concentration of the ITO layer which dramatically increases the loss of this MOS mode. The seamless integration of such a strong optical beam modulation into an existing silicon-on-insulator platform bears significant potential towards broadband, compact and efficient communication links and circuits.},

Besides having fundamental implications for classical and quantum optics, nanoscale metamaterials provide a platform for developing disruptive novel technologies, in which a combination of both the electric and magnetic radiation field components at optical frequencies is relevant to engineer the light-matter interaction. Thus, an experimental investigation of the spatial distribution of the photonic states at the nanoscale for both field components is of crucial importance. Here we experimentally demonstrate a concomitant deep-subwavelength near-field imaging of the electric and magnetic intensities of the optical modes localized in a photonic crystal nanocavity. We take advantage of the âcampanile tipâ, a plasmonic near-field probe that efficiently combines broadband field enhancement with strong far-field to near-field coupling. By exploiting the electric and magnetic polarizability components of the campanile tip along with the perturbation imaging method, we are able to map in a single measurement both the electric and magnetic localized near-field distributions.},

Here we use the âCampanileâ nano-optical probe to spectroscopically image exciton recombination within monolayer MoS2 with sub-wavelength resolution (60 nm), at the length scale relevant to many critical optoelectronic processes. Synthetic monolayer MoS2 is found to be composed of two distinct optoelectronic regions: an interior, locally ordered but mesoscopically heterogeneous two-dimensional quantum well and an unexpected âŒ300-nm wide, energetically disordered edge region. Further, grain boundaries are imaged with sufficient resolution to quantify local exciton-quenching phenomena, and complimentary nano-Auger microscopy reveals that the optically defective grain boundary and edge regions are sulfur deficient. The nanoscale structureâproperty relationships established here are critical for the interpretation of edge- and boundary-related phenomena and the development of next-generation two-dimensional optoelectronic devices.},

Placed at the end of a scan probe, the device delivers optimal near-field properties, including highly efficient far-field to near-field coupling, ultralarge field enhancement, nearly background-free imaging, independence from sample requirements, and broadband operation. We performed {\textasciitilde}40-nanometerâresolution hyperspectral imaging of indium phosphide nanowires via excitation and collection through the probes, revealing optoelectronic structure along individual nanowires that is not accessible with other methods.

As most textbooks about this powerful computing paradigm date back to the 1960s and 1970s, it fills a void and forges a bridge from the early days of analog computing to future applications. The idea of analog computing is not new. In fact, this computing paradigm is nearly forgotten, although it offers a path to both high-speed and low-power computing, which are in even more demand now than they were back in the heyday of electronic analog computers. This first chapters of this book define the notion of analog computing and cover the early history of mechanical and electromechanical analog computers before focusing on the development and the basics of electronic analog computing elements and computers based on these. Two chapters give an introduction to the programming of analog computers with a number of detailed sample problems and solutions. These problems range from simple mass-spring-damper systems to predator-prey simulations and conformal mappings. The following chapters introduce the basic concepts of hybrid computers and digital differential analyzers, the latter of which offer an enormous potential for future applications based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or the like. The second half of the book is dedicated to an overview of typical applications of analog computers based on a comprehensive bibliography. The last chapter describes future prospects for the analog computing paradigm.},
